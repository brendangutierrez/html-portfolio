<p>I was born in Texas, but grew up in Connecticut, where my passion for coding first took root. As a kid, I was always curious, and that curiosity led me down an exciting path of exploration and discovery.</p>

<p>I pursued my edication at the University of Connecticut, where I earned a degree in Finance. During my time there, I had the opportunity to make long lasting relationships.</p>

<p>Professionaly, I've had the privledge of working in Market Research, where I intefied trends among current users and their expereince with our webservice products. My journey led me to understand the inner functions of the IT tools Gartner provided, which have enriched my skills and perspectives.</p>

<p>When I am not busy I like to design concept interfaces on my computer and go on quick runs.</p>

<p>In my heart, I carry a deep belief that it's never too late to restart your career. Therefore, I my mission is to try new things and to never back down on challenges.</p>
